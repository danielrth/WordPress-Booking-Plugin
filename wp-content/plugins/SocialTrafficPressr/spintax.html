<h1>How to use spintax:</h1>
<p>Spintax (for our purposes) is simply putting special characters around words so that the software will randomly rotate through them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Example: Let’s say that you are posting a comment and you want to cycle through synonyms that express how much you like the post..<br>
&nbsp;<br>
All you do is put them in Spintax and the software will randomly rotate through the words and pick a random one each time it posts.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How is it done</h2>
<p>It’s simple, you simply put <span style="color: #0000ff;">{</span> before all the information, put <span style="color: #0000ff;">}</span> at the end of the information, and put&nbsp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">|</span>&nbsp; in between each piece of information. Confusing I know so I will demonstrate.<br>
